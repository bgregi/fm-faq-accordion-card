## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS

### What I learned

This was definetely a step up for me, as I had to learn many new things. I tried to do the whole challenge using only CSS and HTML (no Javascript), which made me have to learn how to deal with SASS. I learned SASS through its official documentation, and had a great experience with it, which I intend to repeat in the next challenges.

I also had to deal with managing states with CSS, something I had no previous experience with.

### Continued development

I'm aware that I haven't done a perfect job, since my desktop layout doesn't really work for every screen size. This is why I intend to focus on positioning the elements in ways that work for different screens.

### Useful resources

- [Pure CSS Accordion](https://codepen.io/raubaca/pen/PZzpVe?editors=1100) - This helped me greatly in understanding the possibilities of CSS and SASS for managing HTML states.
